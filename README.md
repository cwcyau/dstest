# Data Science Skills Exercise

The dataset provided in `expression.csv` consists of gene expression levels measured for 30 genes from the tumours of 267 different patients. Each patient's tumour has an associated clinical grade classification given in `grade.csv`.

You are asked to conduct an exploratory analysis of this dataset and to report your findings. This should be presented in the form of an RMarkdown or Jupyter notebook (or equivalent).

The following suggestions may inspire your investigations:

- Why genes are associated with high-grade tumours?
- Can you identify any sub-groups of patients? Is there any sub-structure in the data?
- Are there any patient samples which look unusual? What might you do about them?

You are not expected to spend more than 4 hours on this analysis.
